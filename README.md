# Prox-Browser-Extension
An extension similar to Beni (joinbeni.com), where when users are on websites like Amazon, Target, Walmart, etc. they will have a popup that scrapes those websites, Facebook marketplace, and craigslist to find similar new and used items + scrapes websites of smaller stores in the local proximity to provide alternative purchasing options.
